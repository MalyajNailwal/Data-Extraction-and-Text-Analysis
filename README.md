## Features

- Data extraction from web pages, PDFs, and other sources.
- Text cleaning and preprocessing.
- Implementation of various NLP techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization.
- Visualization of text data and results.
- Support for multiple data formats.

## Getting Started

To get a copy of this project up and running on your local machine, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You will also need a few libraries which can be installed using pip.

## Installation

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy nltk beautifulsoup4 requests matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MalyajNailwal/Data-Extraction-and-Text-Analysis.git
   cd Data-Extraction-and-Text-Analysis
   ```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script and follow the instructions within to run the analyses.

3. Modify the code as necessary to suit your specific data extraction and analysis needs.

## Data Sources

This project can handle various types of data sources, including:

- Web scraping from HTML pages using BeautifulSoup.
- Text extraction from PDF files.
- CSV files and other structured data formats.

Ensure you have the permissions to access and use the data you are extracting.

## Text Analysis Techniques

This project utilizes several text analysis techniques including:

- **Tokenization**: Splitting text into words or sentences.
- **Stemming**: Reducing words to their base or root form.
- **Lemmatization**: Similar to stemming, but it provides a meaningful base form.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Determining the sentiment or emotional tone behind a body of text.
- **Data Visualization**: Using libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize results.

## Results

The results of the text analysis can be visualized using various plots and charts. The specific outputs will depend on the data and analyses performed.
